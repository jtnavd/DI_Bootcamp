# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["There’s a lady who's sure",c, "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There’s a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and she’s buying a stairway to heaven
