// Given a item price and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket, determine whether or not you can afford the item.
// Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
// Quarters  = 0.25
// Dimes = 0.10
// Nickels = 0.05
// Pennies = 0.01
// To illustrate:
changeEnough([25, 20, 5, 0], 4.25) should return true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50 which is bigger than 4.25 (the total amount due)

// Examples

// changeEnough([2, 100, 0, 0], 14.11) ➞ false
// changeEnough([0, 0, 20, 5], 0.75) ➞ true
