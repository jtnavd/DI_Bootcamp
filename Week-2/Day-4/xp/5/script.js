function myBill()
// Add the stock and prices objects to your js file.
// Create an array called shoppingList with the following items: “banana”, “orange”, and “apple”. It means that you have 1 banana, 1 orange and 1 apple in your cart.
// Create a function called myBill() that takes no arguments.
// The function should return the total price of your shoppingList. In order to do this you must follow these rules:
// The item must be in stock.
// If the item is in stock find out the price in the prices object.
// Call the myBill() function.
// Bonus: If the item is in stock, decrease the item’s stock by 1
